IoT Air Pollution Monitoring System
IoT (Internet of Things) has become an integral part of our lives and it has already made an impact in various sectors, including the environment. Air pollution is a severe problem that has been affecting our planet for years. Therefore, there is a need for a reliable and efficient air pollution monitoring system to protect ourselves from its hazardous effects. An IoT-based air pollution monitoring system is an ideal solution that can provide real-time data and insights about the air quality in a particular area.

An IoT based air pollution monitoring system consists of several hardware and software components that work together to collect and process data. The hardware components include sensors, microcontrollers, and communication modules. The software components consist of a cloud platform, a mobile application, and a web-based dashboard.
